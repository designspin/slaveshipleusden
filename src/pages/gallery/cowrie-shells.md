  The cowrie was an important currency during the period of the slave trade in
  West Africa. The shell was utilised for both very modest everyday payments as
  well as very large transactions. The cowries were used for ballast on the VOC
  ships on their return voyages to Europe. In the Netherlands, the shells were
  then sold to the WIC for export to West Africa. Amsterdam and London were the
  main European cities for the trade in cowries. Traders would travel to
  Amsterdam from France, Denmark and Portugal to purchase cowries
