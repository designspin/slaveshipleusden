description: >-
  St Georges Castle is located on the Gold Coast, now Southern Ghana. First
  built by the Portuguese in 1482 and named SÃ£o Jorge da Mina (Saint George of
  the mines). It was the first trading post built on the Gulf of Guinea, so is
  the oldest European building in existence below the Sahara. The Dutch seized
  the fort in 1637, and took over all the Portuguese Gold Coast in 1642. It was
  used by the Dutch until 1814; the Dutch referred to the castle and the
  surrounding village as Elmina. In 1872 the Dutch Gold Coast, including the
  fort, became a possession of the British Empire.
