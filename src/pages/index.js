              <p>This book is an adaptation of my scientific research into the history of the Leusden, one of the last slave ships of the West-Indian Company (WIC). This type of vessel was usually deployed for other activities following one or more slave voyages. The Leusden is an exception and has exclusively undertaken slave voyages from her maiden voyage in 1719 until she foundered in 1738, amounting to ten crossings in total.  During those ten voyages, 6564 captives were embarked; 1639 of whom did not survive the crossing. An additional 102 captives perished in the slave stores prior to being sold, resulting in an overall death count of 1741. This proportion constituted more than a quarter of the number of captives embarked in Africa; an incredible waste of human lives.</p>

              <h4>Update (April 2019)</h4>
              <p>At the moment I am doing research for a book about a director-general of the Dutch West India Company (WIC). From 1621 â€“ 1738 the WIC was given a monopoly for trade and navigation in the Atlantic  (the Americas and West-Africa) by the Dutch government. During a short period in the 18th century he WIC was one of the worlds most important slave trading organisations. The director-generals were very powerful persons in West-Africa.</p> 
              <p>In cooperation with professor Jerzy Gawronski (maritime archeologist) we will write an updated  version of the last voyage of the Leusden, based on the research which has been done about the possible wrecksite of the ship.</p>
