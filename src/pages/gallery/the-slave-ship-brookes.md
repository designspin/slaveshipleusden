description: >-
  The slave ship Brookes, build in 1781 in Liverpool, made ten voyages between
  1781 and 1805. A total of 5122 captives were embarked of whom 4729 reached the
  Americas alive. The image of the Brookes was very important for the British
  abolitionists. With this image they were able to show the people how inhumane
  and terrible the trade in human beings was.
