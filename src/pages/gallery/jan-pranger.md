  Jan Pranger was Director-General of the Dutch West India Company on the Gold
  Coast (now Ghana) in West Africa from 1730 to 1734. He stands in his office at
  the Fort Elmina trading post. All the details underscore the importance of his
  position: the servant with the parasol (pajung), the commanderâ€™s baton on the
  table and the monogram, GWC, of the Chartered West India Company on the
  tablecloth. As is told in chapter 10 Jan Pranger was Director- General during
  the 7th and the 8th voyage of the Leusden.
