  The shipyard of the Admiralty of Amsterdam was opposite the wharf where the
  Leusden was built. The governors of the WIC often asked the people from the
  Admiralty to help them to check the construction of new ships before they gave
  the shipbuilder their final consent to build the ship. The painting is from
  Ludolf Bakhuijsen and painted between 1655 and 1660. The WIC was established
  in 1621 so at the time Bakhuijsen painted the Admiralty shipyard the WIC was
  already building their ships opposite this place.
