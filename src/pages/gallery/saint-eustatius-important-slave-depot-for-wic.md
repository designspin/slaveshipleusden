  During a short period the island of Saint Eustatius was the most important
  slave depot for the WIC. From here slaves were distributed to the surrounding
  island. The Leusden was the first WIC slave ship to deliver captives to this
  island in 1719. Because of the dominance of the English in the slave trade the
  Dutch decided to stop the trade to Saint Eustatius and Surinam became the most
  important region for the delivery of African captives.
