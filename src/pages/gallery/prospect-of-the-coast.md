  This picture is based on accounts of Jean Barbot (1655-1712) a slave trader,
  who was in the employment of the Compagny du Sénégal. His account of his
  visits to West Africa was published in 1732. In 1745 John Raphael Smith made
  this painting according to the writings of Barbot. On the painting from left
  to right: Elmina (Dutch), Saint Jago (Dutch army residence), Cape Corse or
  Cape Coast Castle (British), Fort Royal (British) and Mouri or Mouree (Dutch).
